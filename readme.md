This repo is just a way to practice using apis. 

Here I was able to add go to developer.google.com to create an account.
Then I was able to generate an API key. 
I made sure to research safe practices to keep API keys hidden when pushing to git hub repositories. 

There is a lot of information on: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos I will continue to read through the documentation to see what else I can do. 

Will continue to update this repository as I work more through this small project. 

Overall as of right now, the main purpose was to try to call an API and to practice safe handling of API keys.
